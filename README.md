# Cpp-TicTacToe
## Simple TicTacToe game in C++

This is a little game I made to familiarize myself with C++. The game begins by the board being drawn with 9 squares labeled 1-9, players than take turns
filling in the squares by entering the number corresponding to the square they wish to choose. Player 1 will insert X's and Player 2 O's. The game will then
proceed, consistently checking the values of each possible connected line of 3 to see if they match, when a match is found that player wins and the game is complete.
